<p> My name is Gerae and I just wanted to let you know coding is not that hard but its also not that easy trust me. Good news though you just clicked onto my all about me portfolio.</p>
<h2> ABOUT ME!!!</h2>
<p> This is my first year coading. I wanted to try it because all of my frineds where coding in school and they liked it so I thought why not. I'm in a summer program called "Girls Who Code"and its a really good program for the summer. I learned so much here from everybody.<p>
